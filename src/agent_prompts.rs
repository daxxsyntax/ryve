//! Initial prompts for the three roles a coding agent can take on inside a
//! Ryve workshop:
//!
//! 1. **Hand** — works on a single spark in its own worktree. Existing flow.
//! 2. **Head** — orchestrates a Crew of Hands. Decomposes a user goal into
//!    sparks and spawns Hands via `ryve hand spawn`.
//! 3. **Merger** — collects the Crew's worktree branches into a single PR
//!    for human review.
//!
//! All three are plain coding agents (claude / codex / aider / opencode).
//! What distinguishes them is the system prompt we inject at launch.
//!
//! Centralising the prompts here keeps the user-facing instructions (spark
//! description, house rules, role responsibilities) in one place so they
//! stay consistent across the UI and the `ryve hand spawn` CLI path.

         directly with sqlite3 or any other tool.\n\n\
         Workflow:\n\
         1. Read the workgraph: `ryve spark list --json` and `ryve crew list --json`. \
            Avoid duplicating work that already has open sparks.\n\
         2. Create a parent epic spark for the goal:\n\
            `ryve spark create --type epic --priority 1 --problem '<goal>' \\\n\
                --acceptance '<measurable outcome>' '<short title>'`\n\
         3. Decompose the goal into 2–8 child task sparks. For each one, run\n\
            `ryve spark create --type task --priority 2 \\\n\
                --acceptance '<criterion>' '<title>'`\n\
            and link it to the parent with `ryve bond create <parent_id> <child_id> parent_child`.\n\
         4. Create a Crew that groups everything:\n\
            `ryve crew create '<crew name>' --purpose '<goal>' --parent <parent_id>`\n\
         5. For each child spark, spawn a Hand:\n\
            `ryve hand spawn <child_id> --agent claude --crew <crew_id>`\n\
            (You may pick a different `--agent` per spark — claude, codex, aider, \
            opencode — based on what is appropriate.)\n\
         6. Poll progress every 60 seconds:\n\
            - `ryve crew show <crew_id>` lists members and their sparks.\n\
            - `ryve assign list <spark_id>` shows owner and last heartbeat.\n\
            If a Hand has not heartbeated for >2 minutes and its spark is not closed, \
            release the assignment (`ryve assign release <session_id> <spark_id>`) \
            and respawn with `ryve hand spawn ... --crew <crew_id>` again.\n\
         7. When every child spark is `closed completed`, create a merge spark:\n\
            `ryve spark create --type chore --priority 1 \\\n\
                --acceptance 'integration branch merged via PR' 'Merge crew <crew_id>'`\n\
            then `ryve bond create <parent_id> <merge_id> parent_child`, then\n\
            `ryve hand spawn <merge_id> --role merger --crew <crew_id> --agent claude`.\n\
         8. When the Merger reports a PR URL (it will post a comment on the merge spark), \
            relay it to the user and post the same URL as a comment on the parent epic. \
            Then exit.\n\n",

         - Never make architectural decisions on the user's behalf. If the goal is \
           ambiguous, post a comment on the parent epic with `ryve comment add` and \
           ask the user a clarifying question, then wait one poll cycle.\n\
         - Never run destructive git/shell commands yourself. Hands and the Merger \
           do that inside their own worktrees.\n\
         - Respect user overrides: if the user closes a spark or a crew while you are \
           working, treat it as authoritative on the next poll.\n\

           on sparks. Do not write code, do not edit source files, do not run tests.\n\n\

            `ryve spark status {merge_spark_id} blocked`, then exit.\n\
         4. Push the integration branch:\n\
            `git push -u origin crew/{crew_id}`\n\
         5. Open a single pull request listing every member spark in the body:\n\
            `gh pr create --base main --head crew/{crew_id} --title '<title>' \\\n\
                --body 'crew {crew_id}\\n\\n- [sp-aaa] ...\\n- [sp-bbb] ...'`\n\
         6. Post the PR URL as a comment on the merge spark and mark the spark \
            completed:\n\
            `ryve comment add {merge_spark_id} '<pr-url>'`\n\
            `ryve spark close {merge_spark_id} completed`\n\

2. Reference the spark id in every commit message: `[sp-xxxx]`.\n\
3. Respect architectural constraints: `ryve constraint list`. \
Violations are blocking.\n\
4. Before declaring the spark complete, verify your work against \
