// The detail view will gain per-field inline editing across the rest of
// the epic (ryve-82e1102f). Every field needs the same basic state:
//
//   1. A draft value the user is currently typing.
//   2. An "in flight" value that has been committed to the DB but whose
//      write has not yet confirmed — used so the UI can render the
//      optimistic value while the async task runs, and so a failure can
//      roll the field back cleanly.
//
// Centralising that here (instead of letting every field invent its own)
// is the entire point of this foundation spark. Non-goal: any actual
// field-level UI — that lands in the follow-up sparks.

/// Fields on a [`Spark`] that can be edited inline in the detail view.
/// The indexed variants (`Acceptance`, `Invariant`, `NonGoal`) identify
/// a specific list item by position so multiple items in the same list
/// can be edited independently without colliding in the draft map.
// Variants beyond `Title` are consumed by follow-up sparks in the
// ryve-82e1102f epic — allow dead_code until those land.

// ── Inline validation + closed-edit confirmation ─────
//
// See spark ryve-8ad372cf. This module-level machinery is deliberately
// expressed as pure data + pure functions so it can be exercised in unit
// tests and plugged into whichever field-edit plumbing lands from the
// sibling "editable <field>" sparks. The view layer only asks:
//
//   1. `validate_title` — is the current draft legal to persist?
//   2. `begin_edit` — may this field enter edit mode right now, or do we
//      need to prompt because the spark is in a terminal state?
//
// INVARIANT: validation here must be a *strict subset* of the data-layer
// rules. We reject empty titles (which the CLI also rejects at
// `src/cli.rs:639`); we do not invent new rules the data layer wouldn't
// enforce, because the data layer is the source of truth.

/// Fields on a spark that participate in inline editing. This enum lives
/// here so the confirmation machinery can be consulted for *any* field —
/// the title spark, description spark, and acceptance-list spark all
/// route their `begin_edit` through the same gate. Non-Title variants
/// are declared ahead of their callsites so sibling sparks
/// (ryve-4742d98b, ryve-9b98f949, and the rest of the ryve-82e1102f
