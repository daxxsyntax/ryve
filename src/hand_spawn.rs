//! Shared CLI-driven spawn flow for Hands and the Merger.
//!
//! The Ryve UI spawns Hands via `workshop::Workshop::spawn_terminal` so the
//! agent runs inside an `iced_term` widget. The Head, however, is itself a
//! coding-agent subprocess and needs to spawn child Hands without going
//! through iced. This module provides the data-layer half of that flow:
//!
//!   1. Create a git worktree for the new Hand.
//!   2. Persist an `agent_sessions` row.
//!   3. Persist a `hand_assignments` row claiming the spark with the
//!      requested role (Owner / Merger).
//!   4. Optionally add the new session to a Crew.
//!   5. Compose the appropriate initial prompt (regular Hand or Merger).
//!   6. Launch the coding-agent subprocess **detached** with the system
//!      prompt injected via the agent's `--system-prompt`-style flag, full
//!      auto enabled, environment configured (`RYVE_WORKSHOP_ROOT`, `PATH`),
//!      cwd set to the new worktree, and stdout/stderr redirected to a log
//!      file under `.ryve/logs/hand-<session_id>.log`.
//!
//! The detached child process keeps running after the `ryve hand spawn`
//! invocation exits, so the Head can fire-and-forget. Ryve's UI picks up
//! the new session on its next workgraph poll.
