//! Head archetype model + registry [sp-fbf2a519 / ryve-982bddb8].
//!
//! A **Head** is a coding-agent subprocess that orchestrates a Crew of
//! Hands (see `docs/HEAD_ARCHETYPES.md`). Every Head is spawned under an
//! *archetype* — a typed contract that spells out what the Head is for,
//! which prompt template it boots with, which coding agent to launch by
//! default, which Hand archetypes it is allowed to delegate to, and what
//! write discipline its Crew operates under.
//!
//! Archetypes are declared once, here, in a data-driven registry. The CLI
//! (`ryve head archetype list`) lists them from this registry, while
//! `ryve head spawn --archetype <name>` validates against
//! `agent_prompts::HeadArchetype::from_str` (`build`, `research`,
//! `review`). Adding a new archetype requires extending both
//! [`Registry::builtins`] and the `HeadArchetype` enum in `agent_prompts`.
//! In the future, archetypes may be looked up purely by registry name
//! (or a TOML overlay in `.ryve/`), removing the CLI-parser edit.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - Archetype names are unique within a workshop. [`Registry::new`]
//!   returns [`RegistryError::DuplicateName`] if two archetypes share a
//!   name, and [`Registry::builtins`] is covered by a unit test to make
//!   sure the compiled-in defaults never regress on this.
