# Ryve Workshop

You are working inside a **Ryve Workshop**. Ryve manages tasks (called *sparks*) in an embedded workgraph stored at `.ryve/sparks.db`.

## Rules

1. **Always reference spark IDs** in commit messages: `fix(auth): validate token expiry [sp-a1b2]`
2. **Work in priority order** — P0 is critical, P4 is negligible.
3. **Respect architectural constraints** listed above — violations are blocking.
4. **Check required contracts** before considering a spark done.
5. **Do not work on a spark that is already claimed** by another Hand.
6. If you discover a new bug or task, create a spark for it (see commands below).

## Workgraph Commands

Use `ryve-cli` to interact with the workgraph. Run from the workshop root.

### List active sparks

```sh
ryve-cli spark list
ryve-cli spark list --all   # include closed
```

### Create a new spark

```sh
ryve-cli spark create Fix the authentication timeout bug
```

### Update spark status

```sh
ryve-cli spark status sp-a1b2 in_progress
```

### Close a spark

```sh
ryve-cli spark close sp-a1b2 completed successfully
```

### Show spark details

```sh
ryve-cli spark show sp-a1b2
```

### Check contracts for a spark

```sh
ryve-cli contract list sp-a1b2
```

### List architectural constraints

```sh
ryve-cli constraint list
```

Ryve auto-refreshes every 3 seconds. Any changes you make will be picked up by the UI and by other Hands automatically.
