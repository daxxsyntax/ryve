# Guard: refuse to let sparks.db or its SQLite sidecars be staged/tracked.
#
# SQLite treats sparks.db, sparks.db-wal, and sparks.db-shm as a single atomic
# unit. Versioning any one of them (or a stale subset) guarantees torn state
# on checkout/stash and corrupts the Ryve workgraph. See docs/WORKGRAPH.md.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-sparks-db-not-tracked.sh           # checks HEAD + index
#   scripts/check-sparks-db-not-tracked.sh --staged  # checks only the index
#                                                    # (used by pre-commit)

# Pattern matches sparks.db and its SQLite sidecars only (-wal, -shm,
# -journal, -journalNNN). We deliberately do NOT match `.`-separated
# suffixes so unrelated files like sparks.db.md remain allowed.

These files are SQLite state owned by a live process. Tracking them causes
atomic-unit skew and corrupts the workgraph on stash/checkout.

Fix:
  git rm --cached <file>    # untrack without deleting from disk
  # confirm .gitignore covers .ryve/sparks.db and .ryve/sparks.db-*

See docs/WORKGRAPH.md -> "Sidecars must never be tracked".
